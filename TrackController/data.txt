tests were run on my pc: intel i5-1135G7 @ 2.40Ghz, 8Gigs ram, only vscode was open
tests were run on ~500 lines of OR operations
this includes input read and output write times so actual operations/s is greater than stated
tests were run with 10 track blocks connected to the controller
each test was one compile and 10 cycles

AVG cycle time: 3.3ms
WORST cycle time: 5.9ms
AVG operations per second: >=149991
WORST operations per second: >=84229
AVG compile time: 8.1ms
WORST compile time: 13ms
AVG compiled lines per second: 60983
WORST compiled lines per second: 37024


conclusion: if simulating at 60x realtime, all track controllers likely have a limit of ~1500 operations combined
